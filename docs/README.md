# PVME Settings

This is a static HTML app for browsing and managing PVME Discord emojis. The live version is available at [https://pvme.io/pvme-settings/](https://pvme.io/pvme-settings/).

It loads all emojis from `emojis_v2.json`, allows you to search and filter them by name and category, shows which Discord servers each emoji lives on, and lets you copy full, guide-ready Discord emoji strings for easy paste into guides or messages.

## Developing locally

* Install Node.js (for `npx`)
